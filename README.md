#About
This project, created by a beginner in Unreal Engine, aims to showcase the wonders of our solar system.

#Installation
     Before starting, you will need to have the following tools installed on your machine: Git and Unreal Engine 5.4

     1-Clone the Repository
First, you'll need to clone the repository to your local machine. Open a terminal (or Git Bash on Windows) and run the following command: git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repository.git
Replace https://github.com/your-username/your-repository.git with the URL of the repository you want to clone.

     2-Navigate to the Project Directory
Once the cloning process is complete, navigate to the project directory: cd your-repository
Replace your-repository with the name of the directory created by the clone command.

     3-Open the Project in Unreal Engine 5.4
Locate the .uproject file within the cloned repository. This file is the main project file for Unreal Engine.
Windows: Double-click the .uproject file to open it in Unreal Engine 5.4.
Mac: Right-click the .uproject file and select "Open with" -> "Unreal Engine 5.4".
If you haven't yet set up Unreal Engine 5.4, make sure it is correctly configured to open .uproject files.

    4-Generate Project Files
If the project requires additional setup (such as generating project files), follow these steps:
Windows: Right-click on the .uproject file and select "Generate Visual Studio project files". If there is a Setup.bat or GenerateProjectFiles.bat script in the repository, run it to set up the project.
Mac: Run the GenerateProjectFiles.command script if available.

   5-Run the Project
After building the project, you can launch it:
Open the project in Unreal Engine 5.4 as described in step 3.
Click "Run" or "Play" to start the project :).

#How_to_Use
